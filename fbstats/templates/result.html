                    foreseeable
                    trouble
                    through purposefully planning, and achieves success through persistence. From your responses
                    it
                    appears that
                    you are reliable and prepared for life's challenges.</p>

            <p class="text-highlight">Extraversion is marked by pronounced engagement with the external world,

                    active.
                    Your
                    answers describe you as someone who enjoys and actively seeks out social occasions, and that
                    you
                    especially
                    enjoy talking with a big group of people.</p>

                <p><strong>Reflective question: </strong><em>Do you prefer to be busy all the time? Why?</em>
                </p>

                <p>This trait refers to the way people express their opinions and manage relationships. From the
                    way you
                    answered the questions, you seem to describe yourself as someone who is willing to make
                    difficult
                    decisions
                    when necessary, and will point out when something is wrong no matter what other people might
                    feel.
                    Your
                    responses suggest that you would say that you can be tough and uncompromising.</p>

                <p><strong>Reflective question: </strong><em>When others are experiencing problems, what do you
                    do?</em>
                </p>

                <p>This trait refers to the way people cope with, and respond to, life's demands. From the way

                    answered the
                    questions, you seem to describe yourself as someone who is generally calm. Based on your
                    responses,
                    you come
                    across as someone who can feel emotional or stressed out by some experiences, however your
                    feelings
                    tend to
                    be warranted by the situation.</p>

                <p><strong>Reflective question: </strong><em>Which situations make you feel under pressure and
                    which
                    situations
                    do not?</em></p>
